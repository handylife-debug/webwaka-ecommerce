# WebWaka E-Commerce Platform - Biological Hierarchical System

## Overview
The WebWaka E-Commerce Platform is a multi-vendor e-commerce solution built with a biological hierarchical system architecture, emphasizing cellular independence and 100% component reusability. The platform aims to provide a robust, secure, and scalable system for online commerce, including specialized features for the Nigerian market. Key capabilities include multi-vendor management, order splitting and fulfillment, B2B access control, and comprehensive security.

## User Preferences
- **Cellular Reusability**: Hardcoded requirement - reuse existing cells and codebase without duplicating functionality
- **Documentation**: Each completed subtask must be fully documented and pushed to GitHub immediately
- **Architecture**: Follow established cellular architecture pattern with client.tsx/server.ts structure
- **Security**: Implement proper encryption, RBAC authorization, and tenant scoping
- **Integration**: Push code to GitHub after each major completion using established connection

## System Architecture

### Core Design Principles
The platform adheres to a "biological hierarchical system" architecture, where each "cell" is a fundamental, 100% reusable functional unit. This includes strict cellular independence, eliminating direct cross-cell imports and relying solely on Cell Bus communication.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide React icons
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based sessions with JWT-like tokens
- **Security**: Comprehensive security hardening including JWT-based authentication, tenant isolation, SQL injection prevention, CSRF protection, and RBAC authorization.

### Key Features & Implementations
- **Cellular Structure**: Organized into `cells/` directory, with subdirectories for `ecommerce/` containing independent cells like `VendorOnboardingManagement`, `MultiStoreMarketplace`, `OrderSplittingFulfillment`, and `B2BAccessControl`.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent and modern design. Vendor and partner dashboards extend existing architectures for reusability.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Designed with tenant-scoped data and proper isolation.
- **E-commerce Capabilities**:
    - **Vendor Onboarding**: System for vendor applications, business details, tax info, and admin approval workflows.
    - **Multi-Store Marketplace**: Separate vendor dashboards, individual store pages with custom branding, product mapping, and store management.
    - **Order Splitting & Fulfillment**: Automated multi-vendor order splitting, fulfillment routing, and unified customer tracking.
    - **B2B Access Control**: Management for wholesale customers, including guest price hiding, category restrictions, and group management.
- **Regional Features**: Includes specific features for the Nigerian market such as Naira currency defaults, CAC registration, tax ID, and 7.5% VAT compliance.

## Phase 3: Cellular Independence Achievements

### TaxAndFee Cell - Complete Cellular Independence âœ…
**Completion Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: ARCHITECT APPROVED - True cellular independence achieved

**Major Transformations:**
- **Hardcoded Logic Elimination**: Converted all static tax rates (7.5% VAT) and fee calculations to database-driven configuration using 3 multi-tenant tables: `tax_configurations`, `fee_structures`, `region_tax_multipliers`
- **Gateway Migration Success**: Eliminated ALL direct cross-cell imports from WholesalePricingTiers and QuoteRequestNegotiation cells, converting 7+ direct calls to Cell Gateway v2 communication via `cellBus.call()`
- **Infrastructure Fixes**: Removed temporary fallback logic in Cell API routes, establishing unified CellBus communication for all cells
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: All operations require tenantId validation with proper database scoping and Redis caching per tenant
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented Redis caching for configuration lookups with tenant-specific cache keys

**Test Coverage Implemented:**
- Gateway contract tests (40+ scenarios) covering API validation, multi-tenant isolation, error handling, performance
- Architectural verification tests with automated cross-cell import detection and compliance reporting
- Health endpoint verification confirming database-driven configuration (hardcodedConfiguration=false)

**Cellular Independence Verified:**
- NO direct cross-cell imports detected in target areas
- ALL inter-cell communication through Cell Gateway v2
- Independent deployability achieved
- Biological hierarchical system architecture principles enforced

This establishes the proven pattern for migrating the remaining 52 cells in the system.
